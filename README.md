# 🚢 Data Visualization II – Titanic Dataset
   This project focuses on exploring the Titanic dataset using Python's data visualization 
  libraries such as Seaborn and Matplotlib. The goal is to understand how age, gender, and 
  survival status are related by visualizing their distributions using box plots.

# 📌 Objective
Analyze age distribution with respect to gender.
Examine how survival status affects age distribution.
Identify patterns and outliers in the data.
Demonstrate the power of visualization in uncovering insights.

# 📁 Dataset
Source: Inbuilt Titanic dataset from Seaborn
Features used:
age – Age of the passenger (numeric)
sex – Gender of the passenger (nominal)
survived – Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes, nominal)

# 📊 Visualization
Box plot of age distribution by gender (sex) and survival status (survived).

# 🔍 Key Insights
Females had higher survival rates across all age groups.
Younger males had better survival chances than older males.
Median age of survivors was generally lower than non-survivors.
Outliers were detected, particularly among older passengers.

# 🛠️ Tools Used
Python 3
Pandas
Seaborn
Matplotlib

# ✅ Outcome
This project demonstrates how data visualization helps uncover patterns in survival data and provides insight into social behaviors during historical events like the Titanic disaster.
